# Description
1. Read literature
2. I got acquainted with the functions, proceeded to perform tasks

## Tasks
### Task 1
Walked through the array, checked with operator% 2 === 0

### Task 2
4 functions that receive an array in parameters, 2 index and an operator

### Task 3
Created a prompt, checked all the proposed parameters

### Task 4
Sorted the string and each element of the array, checked for identity

### Task 5
I created a handicap that works until ParseInt is NaN, after that I add ParseInt to the variable and jump until the next moment when ParseInt is NaN again

### Task 6
I checked the length of the second line, began to slice a substring with the same length from the first line and compare, if it matched, jumped to the length of the second line.

### Task 7
I removed the last elements so that the length of the line was divisible by 3, first added the next 2 elements to a new line, then added the third. At the end, I added the cut elements.

### Task 8
With the help of split (" ") added all the elements to the array, went through the for and selected the element with the longest length.

### Task 9
I went through all the elements and compared with a number, if the element was larger, added to a new array

### Task 10
Explained during the lecture

### Task 11
I went through the numbers, filtered out only the even ones, and began to split the resulting numbers into numbers and check each one. If all turned out to be even, added to the line.

### Task 12



### Task 13
Created for, inside for, inside another for and using mathematical compounds

### Task 14
Created a variable max = -Infity, and a variable sum = 0, went through all negative numbers and added one variable, compared it with the sum and replaced max if it was greater

### Task 15
I checked the object for duplicate values, in which case I added them to the array. Replaced key and value in places

### Task 16
Sorted the array by element "percentage", checked if the value readStatus was true, added the value of "book" to the array

### Task 17
Sorted the object by keys, added keys to one array, values to another, compared for complete identity.
