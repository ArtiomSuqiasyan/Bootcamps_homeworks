# Description
1. Read the theory
2. Looked at the link aaa, played with the values, answered questions.
3. Manually wrote a function for ParseFloat
4. I manually wrote a function for ParseInt, which "cleans" the decimal system of digits, and also changes between binary, octal and decimal systems.
The rest will be copy-paste :)
