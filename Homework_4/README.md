# Description

## Reading material and doing simple tasks

1. I read all the material on the topic.
2. Opened git bash and with the help of the command "cd" went to the desired section
3. Using the command "mkdir Homework_4" create folder Homework_4.
4. Moved to folder "Homework_4
5. Went to the arrays section, for each task through the git command created a separate file and completed all the tasks.
6. Repeated the same steps with other sections.

## Completing required tasks
After reading the material and completing simple tasks, I began to do my homework.

### Task 1
I checked the division of a number by 2 using the remainder. If remainder === 0, the number is divisible by 2, otherwise it is not.
The remainder was checked using the% operator.

### Task 2
Before finding the third side of the triangle, I checked the numbers for validity.
1. The value of both sides must be positive.
2. The sum of both sides must be less than 180
If both options are correct, to get the third party out of 180, he subtracted the sum of two hundred tons.

### Task 3
Before moving the last digit forward, I checked it for 0. If after passing the digit === 0, I return the same number. Otherwise, I get a number using the remainder operator when dividing by 10 (number% 10). I create a variable count, using a while loop, I remove the last digit from the number until the number becomes 0, gradually increasing the variable count. Using exponentiation, I mathematically collect a new number.

### Task 4
I check with the "if" operators, starting with complex checks.

### Task 5
Collected the numbers into an array, sorted them using the method "sort()" and returned them back to variables

### Task 6
Checked with the help of "if" operators. The product will be positive if.
1. All 3 numbers are positive.
2. One of the numbers is positive, the rest are negative.
The product will be 0 if one of the numbers is 0

### Task 7
Split the number into numbers using the above steps and compare with the proposed number.

### Task 8
I have already done this on your computer in front of an audience :))
If the number is between -10 and 10, or ends in 0, I return the number.
Received the last number, using the while loop and the count variable, I got the number of digits. To get the first digit, I subtracted the power count from 10-1 from the number. I subtract 1 so that only the first digit remains. Then, using the method Mat.floor rounded. With the help of simple mathematical operations, I got a new number.

### Task 9
First, I take out the root of the resulting number, because in case of division, the numbers will be repeated. This will allow for fewer loop iterations.
I create a handicap loop that starts at 2 and ends at the red root.
If at some point the number is divisible by "i", I interrupt the loop and show that the number is complex. Otherwise, simple.

### Task 10
I did it during the interview :)
I create an array with elements [0, 1].
Using a for loop, I constantly add the sum of the previous two numbers to the array. I display the last element of the array.

### Task 11
Created 2 variables ...
Divided the number into digits, in variable "sum" he collected the amount, in variable "product" he collected the product.
Divided the "product" by the "amount" and, with the help of if, brought out the desired answer

### Task 12
Created a new variable, assigned "". I went through the "odds". Using "if" I checked if the element is equal to "_", put a word from the array into a new line. With the help of another change, whose value was increased by "_". Otherwise, left the elements of the main line.

## Task 13
Created 2 empty arrays for each of the numbers.
Using the "for" loop, I went through all the elements, checked them with typeof === "number" and !isNaN. Then, using the remainder when dividing by 2, I sorted by arrays.

### Task 14
Created 2 variables for each value.
With the help of the "handicap" I went through the elements. Each item checked for a string or number and incremented the value of the corresponding variable.

### Task 15
Created variables "max" and "min", both assigned the length of the first element of the array.
With the help of the for "handicap" went through the elements, starting with the second, because. the first item has already been assigned. Each element was compared with the variables, and if they were more / less than the max / min variables, changed the values.
After the loop, I output the sum of the values.

### Task 16
Created a variable, assigned a value to the modulus of the difference between the first element of the array and the given number.
I walked through the array, got the modulus of the difference of each element and the given number. If the value was less than the value of the variable, it was assigned a new value.

### Task 17
Used the split method with the parameter " ".

### Task 18
I created an array with a length of 100 using "Array", through a loop, put each element under the desired index.

### Task 19
Created an empty array. I created the one loop for, inside a variable "sum", then using another loop I got all the elements of the internal arrays, added the "sum" to a variable, and then pushed the answer into the array created earlier.

### Task 20
I noticed that at first the second row increases by "entered number - 1", then by "entered number - 2" and so on until the end.
Created the variable "result", assigned the value "". Created for, in each iteration created a variable, assigned the value of "i" for further actions. Inside the loop, I created another loop in which I performed mathematical operations. Changed the type to a string, using "\n" increased the number of lines.
The answer turned out to be interactive, when the number changes, the function will return the desired answer.

## Optional tasks

### Task 1
I gave the variables "max" and "min".
With the help of the previously indicated operations, I received each digit of the number. Using the comparison operator, changed the value of variables if it was greater / less than the value of the variable itself. After the end of the cycle, I displayed the difference of variables.

### Task 2
Displayed the binary system of numbers as a string. I created a variable in which I put the initial value "0" and began to increase with each iteration. The variable is needed to increase the power of 2. Using the loop, I got the last value of the string, changed the type to a digit, performed the necessary mathematical operations when converting the binary system to decimal.

### Task 3
Removed the last item and put it in a variable. I used concat to concatenate the first array with the second and add the previously deleted value.

### Task 4
I did it during the interview :)
Created a variable with an initial value of 1, multiplied by a new number on each iteration.

### Task 5
With the help of "if" I checked for the presence of elements from those required by the task, which I had previously placed in the array.
